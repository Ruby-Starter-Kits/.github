# .github
The default files for all Ruby-Starter-Kits projects.

# What is this?

Ruby Starter Kits is a project designed to make getting started with Ruby projects as easy as possible.

Ideally all projects should be just a matter of cloning a repo & it's good to go.

# Keeping up to date

The last thing I want is projects to not be updated for years at a time, so where possible I want to leverage GitHub Actions to automatically update template projects.

# Which projects?

I'm open to everything ruby, but I'm starting with:

* Rails
* Bridgetown
* Middleman
* Hanami
